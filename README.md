# Kaggle-Comp.-Data-Mining
Kaggle Competition using 15 numerical predictors to predict a continuous outcome as part of a final project using R (and some python) for a statistics data mining course. I later went back and extended work to include more models/attempts.

Machine Learning Models attempted for predictions:
* Simple Multiple Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Ridge and Lasso Regression
* Principal Component Regression
* Support Vector Classifiers and Support Vector Machines
* Deep and Prunned Regression Trees
* Bagging and Boosting
* Random Forests (Best Model for Predictions)
* Artificial Neural Networks for Regression
